RBM scrapes the Rose bandwidth usage page and collections stats of a user's bandwidth usage. It currently uses this to send push notifications (via boxcar) when a user's bandwidth usage passes a certain point ("warn level") or when the bandwidth class of a users changes.

It also displays the last 36 hours of entries as a graph, although work to make this a more useful and intuitive graph still needs to be done.

# Usage

The bandwidth monitor is divided into two parts, the web server and the scrape server. Both components currently run independently of each other.

**To start the web server:** `ruby server.rb`
**To start the scrape server:** `ruby scrape_server.rb`

By default the scrape server will start in development mode, to put it into production use the `--production` flag.

# Installation

The following gems are required to run RBM
* sinatra
* datamapper
* haml
* datamapper
* nokogiri
* json
* boxcar_api (httparty)

# TODO

- Add support for normalized bandwidth charts (i.e., bytes downloaded over time)
- Stats such as time until bandwidth cap reduces
- API access for creating/retrieving bandwidth entries
- Possibly merge scrape server and web server

# Security Concerns

Currently RBM scrapes from the Rose bandwidth page by using NTLM, which requires RBM to store and retrieve a user's password. Suitable warnings are included on the registration page, but note that running this on a shared server will result in plain text passwords being stored in the sqlite database.
